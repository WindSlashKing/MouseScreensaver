# MouseScreensaver

A simple script that emulates the famous bouncing DVD screensaver but with your cursor.
The script has some flaws but I don't care enough to fix them.

The flaws include:
- Hardcoded 1920x1080 resolution
- Non-linear mouse movement
- Mouse movement may be choppy
- Sides to bounce off of are almost completely random
